# 🧾 Kii Solidity Contracts

This repository contains smart contracts for the KiiChain ecosystem, written in Solidity.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the development environment and test the contracts locally.

npx hardhat compile
```

### 4. Run the Tests

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

#### ✅ Notes

1. Added basic test: **test/basic-test.ts** for **AirdropNFT**
2. Removed default Hardhat boilerplate: **test/Lock.ts**
